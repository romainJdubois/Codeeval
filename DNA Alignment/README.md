#What is DNA Alignment ?

This directory contains a solution to a challenge submitted on the website [Codeeval](https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/171/).

The goal of this challenge is to produce a program quantifying the likelihood of two DNA sequences being related.
To solve this problem, we implemented a Needleman Wunsch algorithm.
